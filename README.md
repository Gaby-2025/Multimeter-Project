# Multimeter-Project

This multimeter project was developed as part of an effort to build a functional and customizable measuring instrument using an Arduino. Over the course of the project's lifecycle, we went through several iterationsâ€”testing different measurement techniques, integrating and refining code modules, and merging various hardware components into a unified system.

Throughout development, we made significant changes to the original design. We experimented with multiple input methods and display options before finally settling on an OLED display (SSD1306) for visual output and a rotary encoder for menu navigation. These choices gave our project a more user-friendly and compact interface.
Despite our efforts, the final version of the code did not perform exactly as intended in all measurement modes. However, the framework we've built for the code can serve as a strong starting point for future development.

We invite future students and hobbyists to explore, modify, and improve the code. Whether you're aiming to add features, improve accuracy, or refactor the menu system, you're welcome to build on what we've started.
