For this multimeter, we used an OLED display (SSD1306) for visual output and a rotary encoder for menu navigation, resulting in a more compact and user-friendly interface.

However, the measurement functions in the final code are not working as intended. Due to time constraints, we were unable to fully troubleshoot or optimize the meter logic. Still, the existing framework provides a solid foundation for further development.

We encourage future students and hobbyists to explore, modify, and improve the code. Whether you're fixing the measurement issues, refining the interface, or adding new features, you're welcome to build on our work.
